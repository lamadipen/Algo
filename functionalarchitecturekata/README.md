# `Functional Core Imperative Shell Kata`

### `The goals of this kata are to:`
##### `1. Implement the BlogController to meet the requirements`
##### `2. Maximize the amount of code that is pure functions`

### `A pure function for our purposes is defined as:`
##### `1. Takes a value and returns a value, with no side effects (for example file system IO)`
##### `2. Has no dependencies`
